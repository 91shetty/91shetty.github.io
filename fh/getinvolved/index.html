People living unsheltered feel unseen, separated, and alone; as if there was an invisible wall between them and those living inside. We can change this by acting on our empathy, beginning with a smile and a hello. </p>

                        <h2> Use Your Passion and Skills </h2>
                        <p> For many people, getting involved means to “fix” an issue or a person. For us, engaging with this issue is simpler than a solution. It’s about opening your heart and reaching out to someone who is suffering with love and compassion. It’s not as much about ‘doing’ as it is about ‘being’. Everyone functions better when they are loved. <br> <br> The exciting thing about reaching out in kindness is that it knows no bounds! We begin by asking ‘what are  your passions, talents, and skills?’, because if you’re passionate about it, you’ll stick with it, and if you’re good at it, you’ll make a difference. Countless beautiful projects have emerged from these simple questions. No matter how you choose to make a connection, the important thing is to do it with love and a desire to see the beauty in each person. By doing this, the most profound change you will see is in yourself. <br> <br> It is not important what you do, but that you begin. Below are simple suggestions and inspiring examples of how you can engage, no matter where you’re at in your journey. </p>

                    <div class="blah">
                        <h3> Begin your journey </h3>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> Make eye contact and smile at people you see living outside </li>
                            <li> Buy a <a style='color:#fff !important;' href='http://www.realchangenews.org/' target="_none">Real Change</a> newspaper </li>
                            <li> Give someone a genuine compliment - maybe you like their smile or hat </li>
                            <li> Every-other time you buy a coffee, purchase a $5 gift card for someone living outside. It allows someone to be a paying customer, which gives a menu item of choice, access to the restroom, and shelter from weather </li>
                            <li> Learn the names of people living outside who you regularly see </li>

                        <ul> 
                            <li> Sarah Snedecker is a visionary, an influencer, and an artist. She founded Street Heart, an annual call to artists in service of Facing Homelessness and people living outside. Dozens of artists formed relationships with and painted portraits of people living homeless. The paintings were auctioned to the community, and proceeds were donated to Facing Homelessness. </li>
                            <li> Feel Good Day grew out of a hair stylist's compassion for people living outside. She invited massage therapists, acupuncturists, other stylists, and pet groomers to join her on an afternoon committed to the personal care of people living homeless. </li>
                            <li> Several people in our community have a passion for knitting. In addition to making cozy gifts for loved ones, they have started knitting hats and scarves for people they see living outside. </li>
                            <li> Carolyn, a pastry chef, owns The Harvest Vine. Annually, Carolyn bakes her famous tarts and sells them to her customers as a fundraiser for Facing Homelessness. On Valentine's Day and other special occasions, Carolyn drops off hundreds of little cakes at our office for people living outside. </li>
                            <li> Amy is an organizer. Through regular visits to our office, Amy has made our space more functional and peaceful, which has made us a more efficient and effective organization! </li>
