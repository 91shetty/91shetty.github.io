										<p>The first step was to get the requirements from our client, HTC. Primarily they wanted us to focus on user on-boarding process which basically was pairing of all the devices within the UA Healthbox, i.e UA Band, UA Scale and UA Heart Rate, with the UA Record iOS application. Secondly they wanted to us test the Fitness Feature on UA Band. <br/> <br/> 
                                            <span class="bold">Creating an Interaction Map </span> <br/>
                                            Next, we laid out an interaction map for the UA Healthbox and the UA Record app to get familiar with its functionality and make it easy to understand and to explain it to users. 
                                            The map design was an iterative process. We started by brainstorming and laying out the screens on a whiteboard. This gave us an idea of the Information Architecture and the workflow of the app and the hardware. The challenge here was to show the functions of the individual devices and its interaction with the app. We sketched out an iteration and quickly tested it out with few users. Based on their feedback we made some changes to come up with the final iteration.

										We met with the professor as to understand his requirements for the visualization. The professor had a team working on a website that showed the risk layer for varous hazards on a map. On applying all the hazard layers on the map, it was difficult for the users to differentiate between the risk layers and summarize the overall risk associated with their property. <br/>
										We had to fit this visualization on a sidebar that opened when a user clicked on a property. The visualization also had to dynamically change and update the risks accordingly based on the property that the user choose to see.

										As a student assistant in the Department of Urban Planning and Research at University of Washington, we were asked to create a visualization to show the different hazard risks that would affect a property. This visualization had to be incorporated into a website that helped potential buyers in assessing the overall risk factor while purchasing a property.
