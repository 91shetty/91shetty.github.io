<h3> Introduction: </h3>
Simply put, I love the game of basketball. Basketball has thought me a lot of life lessons. This class has given me an oppurtunity to give back. So I deciced to combine my love for the sport and talk of the town, namely Golden State Warriors.

Research Question: "Rise of Golden State Warriors basketball team"
Hypothesis:
1)

2)

3) 


<h3> Data Sources: </h3>
http://stats.nba.com/
    - /stats/teaminfocommon
    - /stats/playercareerstats
    - /stats/commonplayerinfo 
    - /stats/commonteamroster
    - /stats/teamdashboardbygeneralsplits

<h3> Methods: </h3>
1) Research


2) Dump Creation


3) Dump Clean up


4) Creation of CSV files


<h3> Findings: </h3>


<h3> Discussion: </h3>


<h3> Conclusions: </h3>


<h3> Future Research: </h3>
1) Dig deeper to analyze other stats
2) Incorporate playoff stats
3) Analyse the stats of the entire team to find deeper answers
4) Use of other visualisations


<h3> Limitations: </h3>
1) The NBA stats API is not publically released. One has to dig deep to find the appropriate API through the network logs on a web browser. On idenifying the right API, we need to call the same through a rest client like interface, and then run the python code to get appropriate data. 
Sometimes the call fails through the python code. In such cases we need to run the API through the rest client again and then run the python code. This process stunted the growth of the project and limited me to rethink the scope of the project.

2) There are other sources of data, such as ....., but these data are under a payroll. As a graudate student, I did not have the funds and hence decided to use only stats.nba.com
