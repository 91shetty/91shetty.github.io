<h2> Final Report | HCDE 598 | DS4UX </h2>

<h3> Introduction: </h3>
Simply put, I love the game of basketball. Basketball has thought me a lot of life lessons. DS4UX has given me an oppurtunity to give back. So I deciced to combine my love for the sport and talk of the town, namely Golden State Warriors basketball team and analyse the reasons for the rise of the team.


<h3> Motivation: </h3>
<h4> 1) Golden State Warriors Team </h4>
    - 2015 NBA Champions
    - 2016 Western Conference Champions
    - The Warriors team beat the Chicago Bulls Record for most wins in a single season by finishing with 73 wins and 9 losses at the end of the 2015-16 regular season.
    - They broke a 131 year old record in all of major professional sports by winning their first 24 games.
    - The team set an NBA record 54 straight regular season home game winning streak beating Chicago Bulls.

<h4> 2) Stephen Curry </h4>
    2015
    - NBA Champion
    - NBA Most Valuable Player
    - NBA 3-Point Contest Champion

    2016
    - NBA Most Valuable Player - Only Player in NBA
    - History to win the award by unanimous votes. NBA Scoring Champion
    - Finished the regular season with 402 3-pointers
    - 7th Player in NBA History to join 50-40-90 club - represents the shooting percentage for the field, beyond the arc and from the free throw line.

<h3> Research Question: "Rise of Golden State Warriors basketball team" </h3>
<h4> Hypothesis: </h4>
1) the 4 factor (Shooting, Rebounding, Free throws, Turnovers) percentage for the team has improved over the past 5 years

2) key stat of Steph Curry's game that has made him an indispensable resource to the GSW's team is shooting percentage

3) key stats of Harrison Barnes, Thompson, Iguodala and Green have impacted the team's success?

<h3> Methods: </h3>
1) Research
First of all, I researched as to which

2) Dump Creation


3) Dump Clean up


4) Creation of CSV files


5) Data Visualization using D3 javascript library

<h3> Discussion/Conclusion: </h3>


<h3> Future Research: </h3>
1) Dig deeper to analyze other stats

2) Incorporate playoff stats

3) Analyse the stats of the entire team to find deeper answers

4) Use of other visualisations


<h3> Limitations: </h3>
1) The NBA stats API is not publically released. One has to dig deep to find the appropriate API through the network logs on a web browser. On idenifying the right API, we need to call the same through a rest client like interface, and then run the python code to get appropriate data. 
Sometimes the call fails through the python code. In such cases we need to run the API through the rest client again and then run the python code. This process stunted the growth of the project and limited me to rethink the scope of the project.

2) There are other sources of data, such as ....., but these data are under a payroll. As a graudate student, I did not have the funds and hence decided to use only stats.nba.com
