							<h2>About Football</h2>
							<p>Children from the age of 5 are taught the game in a planned and methodical way by a team of qualified and experienced coaches. Each session is planned so as to cover all the basic skills. Separate   drills and exercises are used to teach dribbling, passing, and shooting. The sessions consist of both on the ball and off the ball exercises. The off –the- ball exercises, look to teach basic motor skills and the correct technique of moving while playing the game. The on the ball drills teach the trainees to use these techniques while playing the sport.</p>
							<p>Trainees are trained with different size balls (size 3, 4 or 5) depending on their age and ability. The sessions are planned taking into account the age and attention span of the trainees. The sessions are planned in a way that is fun for all the children who are participating. We use fun games which improve the children’s ball control without making the sessions boring or monotonous. The focus is on ensuring that the session is enjoyable for each child regardless of the aptitude of the child.</p>
							<p>After the trainees reach the desired level of proficiency, the academy gets an entry into the inter academy league which is organised by Pitch. This league is conducted on a home and away basis. The match days are on holidays and parents are encouraged to come and cheer their children on. A points table is maintained throughout the year. This gives the children an incentive to work harder in the practice sessions.</p>

							<h2>About Basketball</h2>
							<p>Children from the age of 5 are trained in basketball. They are taught basic ball control, passing and movement on the court. The exercises cover the basic skills (dribbling, passing and shooting). Children are taught to use both hands equally.  The 90 minute sessions are divided into 60 minutes of warm up and drills and 30 minutes of game time.</p>
							<p>Basketballs of size 5, 6 or 7 are used depending on the age and ability of the trainees. The children are taught a variety of exercises which can be practised in groups or alone. The sessions are designed in a way that no exercise is continued for more than 15minutes. This keeps every child interested and prevents the session from becoming boring. The games are designed keeping in mind the limitations of the younger children who do not have the strength to get the ball up to the basket.</p>
							<p>Once the children pick up the game, they play the Pitch inter academy basketball league. All the players get a chance to play these matches. Parents are encouraged to come and watch these games. The best talent is from the league is chosen to represent the basketball club which is run by Pitch. They get to play against other clubs in the state level tournaments.</p>
